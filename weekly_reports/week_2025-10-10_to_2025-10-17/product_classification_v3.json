Running the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index costs $262 with Haiku vs. $817 with Sonnet (~3x more) - full cost breakdown in the thread below.\n\nThere is a stronger case for 4.5 Haiku’s intelligence/cost positioning than 3.5 Haiku, but there is a competitive field of cheaper alternatives with similar intelligence that may make more sense for developers without a reason to need a Claude model specifically - including gpt-oss-120b (reasoning high, ~$75) and Grok 4 Fast (~$40). Claude 4.5 Haiku is the most cost-effective way to access ‘Claude’ but is not the most cost effective model for its level of intelligence.\n\nKey benchmarking results:\n➤🧠 Model Intelligence: In reasoning mode, Claude 4.5 Haiku scores 55 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. This is 8 points lower than Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking) and 4 points lower than Claude 4.1 Opus (Thinking). Claude 4.5 Haiku (Thinking) places marginally ahead of Gemini 2.5 Flash (Reasoning, 54) but behind other reasoning models such as Qwen3 235B 2507 (57), DeepSeek V3.2 Exp (57), and GLM 4.6 (56)\n➤📈 Intelligence Uplift: Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Haiku in November 2024, ~11 months before the release of Claude 4.5 Haiku. Claude 4.5 Haiku is a significant improvement in intelligence compared to Claude 3.5 Haiku, scoring 67% on GPQA Diamond in reasoning mode (compared to 41% for Claude 3.5 Haiku)\n➤⚙️ Notable Strengths: In reasonign mode, Claude 4.5 Haiku performs well in long-context reasoning (70% on AA-LCR, behind only GPT-5 High) and coding (43%, matching GPT-5 High and Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n➤⚡ Non-Reasoning Performance: In non-reasoning mode, Claude 4.5 Haiku scores 42 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. This places the model in line with GPT-5 (minimal, 43) but behind Gemini 2.5 Flash (non-reasoning, 47)\n➤💲 Pricing: Claude 4.5 Haiku is priced at $1/$5 per 1M input/output tokens, which makes it 3x cheaper compared to Claude 4.5 Sonnet (priced at $3/$15 per 1M input/output tokens)\n➤⚙️ Token Efficiency: Anthropic’s Claude models continue to be more token-efficient than all other reasoning models. For Claude 4.5 Haiku (Thinking) -evaluated with a maximum reasoning budget of 64k tokens - we see the model use 39M output tokens to run the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. Its token usage is lower than Claude 4.5 Sonnet (42M) but higher than Claude 4.1 Opus (30M) in thinking mode\n\nKey model details:\n\n➤📏 Context Window: 200K tokens. This is equivalent to Claude 4.5 Sonnet\n➤🌐 Availability: Claude 4.5 Haiku is available via Anthropic‘s API, Google Vertex and Amazon Bedrock. Claude 4.5 Haiku is also available via Claude, and Claude Code",

The sound design in Sora 2 is also really impressive.\n\nBu also, I love Veo 3.1 for its incredibly accurate cultural nuance. So I’ll keep experimenting with both.",

All the metrics go up quite a bit across pretraining, SFT and RL. CORE score of 0.31 is now well above GPT-2 at ~0.26. GSM8K went ~8% -> ~20%, etc. So that's encouraging.\n\nThe model is pretty fun to talk to, but judging from some early interactions I think people have a little bit too much expectation for these micro models. There is a reason that frontier LLM labs raise billions to train their models. nanochat models cost $100 - $1000 to train from scratch. The $100 nanochat is 1/1000th the size of GPT-3 in parameters, which came out 5 years ago. So I urge some perspective. Talking to micro models you have to imagine you're talking to a kindergarten child. They say cute things, wrong things, they are a bit confused, a bit naive, sometimes a little non-sensical, they hallucinate a ton (but it's amusing), etc.\n\nFull detail/report on this run is here:\nhttps://t.co/nWbfKOZLIg\nAnd I pushed the new script run1000 sh to the nanochat repo if anyone would like to reproduce. Totally understand if you'd like to spend $1000 on something else :D\n\nIf you like, I am currently hosting the model so you can talk to it on a webchat as you'd talk to ChatGPT. I'm not going to post the URL here because I'm afraid it will get crushed. You'll have to look for it if you care enough. I'm also attaching a few funny conversations I had with the model earlier into the image, just to give a sense.\n\nNext up, I am going to do one pass of tuning and optimizing the training throughput, then maybe return back to scaling and maybe training the next tier of a bigger model.",

Running the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index costs $262 with Haiku vs. $817 with Sonnet (~3x more) - full cost breakdown in the thread below.\n\nThere is a stronger case for 4.5 Haiku’s intelligence/cost positioning than 3.5 Haiku, but there is a competitive field of cheaper alternatives with similar intelligence that may make more sense for developers without a reason to need a Claude model specifically - including gpt-oss-120b (reasoning high, ~$75) and Grok 4 Fast (~$40). Claude 4.5 Haiku is the most cost-effective way to access ‘Claude’ but is not the most cost effective model for its level of intelligence.\n\nKey benchmarking results:\n➤🧠 Model Intelligence: In reasoning mode, Claude 4.5 Haiku scores 55 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. This is 8 points lower than Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking) and 4 points lower than Claude 4.1 Opus (Thinking). Claude 4.5 Haiku (Thinking) places marginally ahead of Gemini 2.5 Flash (Reasoning, 54) but behind other reasoning models such as Qwen3 235B 2507 (57), DeepSeek V3.2 Exp (57), and GLM 4.6 (56)\n➤📈 Intelligence Uplift: Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Haiku in November 2024, ~11 months before the release of Claude 4.5 Haiku. Claude 4.5 Haiku is a significant improvement in intelligence compared to Claude 3.5 Haiku, scoring 67% on GPQA Diamond in reasoning mode (compared to 41% for Claude 3.5 Haiku)\n➤⚙️ Notable Strengths: In reasonign mode, Claude 4.5 Haiku performs well in long-context reasoning (70% on AA-LCR, behind only GPT-5 High) and coding (43%, matching GPT-5 High and Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n➤⚡ Non-Reasoning Performance: In non-reasoning mode, Claude 4.5 Haiku scores 42 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. This places the model in line with GPT-5 (minimal, 43) but behind Gemini 2.5 Flash (non-reasoning, 47)\n➤💲 Pricing: Claude 4.5 Haiku is priced at $1/$5 per 1M input/output tokens, which makes it 3x cheaper compared to Claude 4.5 Sonnet (priced at $3/$15 per 1M input/output tokens)\n➤⚙️ Token Efficiency: Anthropic’s Claude models continue to be more token-efficient than all other reasoning models. For Claude 4.5 Haiku (Thinking) -evaluated with a maximum reasoning budget of 64k tokens - we see the model use 39M output tokens to run the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index.

You should think of micro models maybe more as very young children (kindergarten etc.), they just don't have the raw intelligence of their larger cousins. If you finetune/train it on your own data you'll probably get some amusing parroting that feels like your writing in style, but it will be slop.\n\nTo achieve what you're looking for you'd want something more like:\n- take your raw data\n- add extensive synthetic data generation rewrites on top (tricky, not obvious, researchy)\n- finetune a state of the art open LLM on it (e.g. tinker)\n- you'd possibly have to mix in a lot of pretraining data to not lose too much raw intelligence during finetuning.\nBasically I'd say getting this to work well is still realm of research and not obvious.\n\nYour best non-research bet is just giving all your writing to something like NotebookLM, which RAGs over it (i.e. references it in chunks). Your data makes it into context windows via RAG but doesn't impact the weights. So the model doesn't exactly \"know you\", but it's maybe the closest you can easily get.",

All components of the Riverflow system deployed on Runware's GPUs. There is also a riverflow-1-mini variant of the offering priced at $50/1k images.\n\nRiverflow 1 is the debut image editing offering from @sourceful, a UK-based brand and packaging design platform backed by Index Ventures and Dylan Field, where it serves as the default image editing option.\n\nLeaderboard note: Riverflow 1 is listed in the “All” tab, separate to our default “First Party Foundation Models” view. Our goal is to reflect and recognize Sourceful’s innovation with Riverflow 1 while maintaining rankings for image editing offerings that we assess to be first-party foundation models.\n\nSee below for comparisons between Riverflow 1 and other leading models in our Image Editing Arena 🧵",

All components of the Riverflow system deployed on Runware's GPUs. There is also a riverflow-1-mini variant of the offering priced at $50/1k images.\n\nRiverflow 1 is the debut image editing offering from @sourceful, a UK-based brand and packaging design platform backed by Index Ventures and Dylan Field, where it serves as the default image editing option.\n\nLeaderboard note: Riverflow 1 is listed in the “All” tab, separate to our default “First Party Foundation Models” view. Our goal is to reflect and recognize Sourceful’s innovation with Riverflow 1 while maintaining rankings for image editing offerings that we assess to be first-party foundation models.\n\nSee below for comparisons between Riverflow 1 and other leading models in our Image Editing Arena 🧵",

Claude 4.5 Haiku is the most cost-effective way to access ‘Claude’ but is not the most cost effective model for its level of intelligence.\n\nKey benchmarking results:\n➤🧠 Model Intelligence: In reasoning mode, Claude 4.5 Haiku scores 55 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. This is 8 points lower than Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking) and 4 points lower than Claude 4.1 Opus (Thinking).

All the metrics go up quite a bit across pretraining, SFT and RL. CORE score of 0.31 is now well above GPT-2 at ~0.26. GSM8K went ~8% -> ~20%, etc. So that's encouraging.\n\nThe model is pretty fun to talk to, but judging from some early interactions I think people have a little bit too much expectation for these micro models. There is a reason that frontier LLM labs raise billions to train their models. nanochat models cost $100 - $1000 to train from scratch. The $100 nanochat is 1/1000th the size of GPT-3 in parameters, which came out 5 years ago. So I urge some perspective. Talking to micro models you have to imagine you're talking to a kindergarten child. They say cute things, wrong things, they are a bit confused, a bit naive, sometimes a little non-sensical, they hallucinate a ton (but it's amusing), etc.\n\nFull detail/report on this run is here:\nhttps://t.co/nWbfKOZLIg\nAnd I pushed the new script run1000 sh to the nanochat repo if anyone would like to reproduce. Totally understand if you'd like to spend $1000 on something else :D\n\nIf you like, I am currently hosting the model so you can talk to it on a webchat as you'd talk to ChatGPT. I'm not going to post the URL here because I'm afraid it will get crushed. You'll have to look for it if you care enough. I'm also attaching a few funny conversations I had with the model earlier into the image, just to give a sense.\n\nNext up, I am going to do one pass of tuning and optimizing the training throughput, then maybe return back to scaling and maybe training the next tier of a bigger model.",

The guy in the video talked about his motivation, goals and how to plan, since the modpack takes a few thousand hours to complete.\nBut all I could think of was that he was actually giving insanely good advice for life.\n\nIt's why I ended up doing the GPT-2 stuff instead. Because GTNH would ultimately just be a quicker way to feel like I achieved something. But the complexity of the game and the time you need to invest in it makes you realize that life is also a game.\nJust a more difficult one with even sparser rewards.

All the metrics go up quite a bit across pretraining, SFT and RL. CORE score of 0.31 is now well above GPT-2 at ~0.26. GSM8K went ~8% -> ~20%, etc. So that's encouraging.\n\nThe model is pretty fun to talk to, but judging from some early interactions I think people have a little bit too much expectation for these micro models. There is a reason that frontier LLM labs raise billions to train their models. nanochat models cost $100 - $1000 to train from scratch. The $100 nanochat is 1/1000th the size of GPT-3 in parameters, which came out 5 years ago. So I urge some perspective. Talking to micro models you have to imagine you're talking to a kindergarten child. They say cute things, wrong things, they are a bit confused, a bit naive, sometimes a little non-sensical, they hallucinate a ton (but it's amusing), etc.\n\nFull detail/report on this run is here:\nhttps://t.co/nWbfKOZLIg\nAnd I pushed the new script run1000 sh to the nanochat repo if anyone would like to reproduce. Totally understand if you'd like to spend $1000 on something else :D\n\nIf you like, I am currently hosting the model so you can talk to it on a webchat as you'd talk to ChatGPT. I'm not going to post the URL here because I'm afraid it will get crushed. You'll have to look for it if you care enough. I'm also attaching a few funny conversations I had with the model earlier into the image, just to give a sense.\n\nNext up, I am going to do one pass of tuning and optimizing the training throughput, then maybe return back to scaling and maybe training the next tier of a bigger model.",

This is 8 points lower than Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking) and 4 points lower than Claude 4.1 Opus (Thinking). Claude 4.5 Haiku (Thinking) places marginally ahead of Gemini 2.5 Flash (Reasoning, 54) but behind other reasoning models such as Qwen3 235B 2507 (57), DeepSeek V3.2 Exp (57), and GLM 4.6 (56)\n➤📈 Intelligence Uplift: Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Haiku in November 2024, ~11 months before the release of Claude 4.5 Haiku. Claude 4.5 Haiku is a significant improvement in intelligence compared to Claude 3.5 Haiku, scoring 67% on GPQA Diamond in reasoning mode (compared to 41% for Claude 3.5 Haiku)\n➤⚙️ Notable Strengths: In reasonign mode, Claude 4.5 Haiku performs well in long-context reasoning (70% on AA-LCR, behind only GPT-5 High) and coding (43%, matching GPT-5 High and Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n➤⚡ Non-Reasoning Performance: In non-reasoning mode, Claude 4.5 Haiku scores 42 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. This places the model in line with GPT-5 (minimal, 43) but behind Gemini 2.5 Flash (non-reasoning, 47)\n➤💲 Pricing: Claude 4.5 Haiku is priced at $1/$5 per 1M input/output tokens, which makes it 3x cheaper compared to Claude 4.5 Sonnet (priced at $3/$15 per 1M input/output tokens)\n➤⚙️ Token Efficiency: Anthropic’s Claude models continue to be more token-efficient than all other reasoning models. For Claude 4.5 Haiku (Thinking) -evaluated with a maximum reasoning budget of 64k tokens - we see the model use 39M output tokens to run the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index.
